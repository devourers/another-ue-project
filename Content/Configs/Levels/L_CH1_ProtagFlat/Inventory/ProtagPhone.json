    "Description": "Standard-issue Interpol personal communication device, which belongs to Grisha. Was modified to include a special physical port so that badge can be used as end-to-end way of securing connections. Also comes with military-grade GPS module which is very hard to disable, and can even survive total phone destruction. Interpol really cares about it's staff security."
